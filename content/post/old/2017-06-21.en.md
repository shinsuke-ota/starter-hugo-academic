Center for Nuclear Study construct a new energy-degraded RI beam line called OEDO beam line in RIKEN RIBF. A commissioning run started on June 15th, 2017 and ended on 21st. First beam in OEDO beam line is delivered and performance of beam line is evaluated.

I conduct the operation of detectors and DAQs, and also contribute to the study of ion optics.

Data analysis is in progress.
